It's no secret that billiard balls can take a beating. From being slammed into one another or dropping them on the floor, there are a number of ways for them to break down and go bad. That's why it's important to take good care of them and know when they need to be replaced. If you put enough money into purchasing your pool table and all the accessories, such as pool cues and racks, then you probably want to make sure those pool balls last as long as possible too. A bad ball can ruin any player's shot because it won't roll straight or bounce the way it should. But when do they actually expire? Can they ever become too old and unusable? We'll explore these questions in this article!

## **What billiard balls are made of?**

Billiard balls can vary in quality based on what materials are used. Often times, pool halls and pool supply stores will carry balls made from plastic materials because it is the cheapest option. However, pool players prefer balls that are made out of a high quality resins to ensure longevity and quality play. The two best materials used in billiard ball production are phenolic resin and polyester resin. These materials make for a dense ball with increased hardness. 

### *How can you tell if your balls are plastic or resin based?*

If your balls  have a high pitched click when they collide with one another, then your pool balls are most likely made out of plastic. If you pool balls have a duller sound and feel to them when they knock together, it is likely that they are pool balls made from resin. Also, resin balls appear to be a lot shinier than their plastic counterparts.

## **How do I know if my billiard balls are bad?**

Pool balls can go bad in a number of ways including:  scratched or nicked, they appear to be warped, they develop a bitter smell (like musty rubber), or they lose their shine. 

### *Scratches and nicks*

Scratches and nicks can make pool balls unpredictable; you never know which way they will spin. A pool ball with only one scratch may appear to be completely fine, but due to the unpredictability, pool players should replace such balls.

### *Warped balls*

Warped pool balls fail to travel in a straight line due to their uneven weight distribution. They may spin or wobble when you hit them with your pool cue, which also makes them unpredictable. A pool player should always replace warped pool balls because they can't control them as well as regular pool balls.

### *Bitter smell*

If you start to notice a bitter smell coming from your billiard balls, it is an indicator that something has gone wrong. The pool balls have begun the process of oxidation; pool balls will emit a musty smell as they wear, but this smell should dissipate quickly and not remain. If the pool balls begin to smell like rubber or like they've been left out in the sun too long, it means pool balls are breaking down due to age. Unfortunately, there is no way to fix the issue. You'll have to buy new balls.

### *Lost shine*

Pool balls also lose their shine like any other pool accessory. The high gloss coating on pool balls helps protect them from warping and chipping as well as helping with grip on the cue ball. Burnishing is major culprit. Burnishing is when pool balls rub against each other during pool games causing material to wear off. To avoid burnishing pool balls, make sure you are always keeping pool balls separate from one another in storage. 

Many pool halls also have pool ball cleaning machines that keep pool balls sparkling bright, but any type of pool ball cleaner should do the trick. Do not use dollar bills! Players often use dollar bills to clean pool balls, but it's not advisable because it will also dull pool balls even further.

## **Why does it matter if my billiard balls are bad?**

If you are a casual player, you may not care about the condition of pool balls, but pool players that compete for money or pool players that play pool to win will want their pool table to have billiard balls with accurate surfaces. A warped pool ball causes off center hits which could result in less accurate shots. Even worse is when you find out your opponent is using a warping pool ball because it's easier for them to shoot accurately and leaves you with an unfair disadvantage. Billiards is a game of accuracy so you want all balls, cues, table and accessories to function properly.

## **How often should you replace billiard balls?**

If you meticulously clean your balls after every time you play pool, then you can probably get away with having them for a long time. If you're okay with the pool balls being dirty after every use and don't really care how long they last, then there's no reason to worry about replacing the pool balls right away. A general rule of thumb is to  replace the pool balls every few years if they're used frequently. If not, they can last as long as 10 years.

## **Cleaning and storing your new billiard balls.**

### *What's the best way to clean your set of balls?*

Cleaning pool balls is pretty straightforward. The best way to do it is by using a soft pool ball cleaner and a microfiber pool ball towel. If you don't have pool ball cleaner, you can always try pool ball wipes. However, these are not as effective at cleaning the pool balls thoroughly because pool ball cleaners have a higher concentration of chemicals that really get into the pool surface and clean off any dirt. It's also a good idea to avoid using a standard pool brush or a rough rag to clean your balls. These can ding up your billiard balls pretty quickly by creating lots of small little abrasions over time.

### *Can you put billiard balls in the dishwasher?*

It may seem like an obvious way  to clean pool balls, but never put pool balls in the dishwasher. The water pressure and high heat from a dishwasher cycle could cause pool balls to become misshapen and have an unintended effect on pool cues when you use them later. 

### *How should you store pool balls?*

The best way to keep your pool balls from going bad is by storing them in a cool, dry, dust-free place. Make sure that the pool ball container isn't within reach of any liquid or humidity as this could cause your balls to warp and smell over time. Keep the balls separated from anything that could scratch or ding them. It's good to store them in a case where each ball has it's own individual space. This ensures the balls don't rub against each other when transporting the case to other locations.

## **What should I do with old, unused, or broken billiards balls?**

So you have a few billiard ball sets laying around. If you no longer play pool, pool billiard balls might be the perfect item to donate to a pool hall or charity so that someone else can continue to enjoy pool. Painted pool balls would make great Christmas decorations since they are round, shiny and certainly festive! 

## **Conclusion**
