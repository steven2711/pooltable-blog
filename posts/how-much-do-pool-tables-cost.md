So you are in the process of buying a pool table, but are confused on all the various prices. You're probably asking yourself what makes them different? Is it the materials? Size or features? What brands are worth a purchase? What should I expect? These are great questions and all reflect on the cost of a pool table. In this article, we'll go over pool tables and points to consider within the cheap, medium priced and expensive pool table range.

## **How much is the cheapest pool table?**

### Pricing

Cheap pool tables are readily available for purchase at your local department store or discount retailer. They can range in price anywhere from $500-$1000 depending upon the size and brand, but typically cost around $600-700. They can be used in any home environment as long as they fit the desired space. Some cheap brands can even be used outdoors. Pool tables that are on the cheaper end of the spectrum are usually no taller than 34 inches.

### Materials

What makes these cheap pool tables so affordable? These models use lower quality materials than their more expensive counterparts to reduce production costs. Usually pool tables of this price range are only made from fiberboard, which is not durable over the long term. Even the playing surface will have a wood backing rather than conventional slate. And most of the time the wood is a cheaper MDF material. Also, cheap pool tables usually have laminate tops with poorly constructed legs that won't last very long. A downside is that some people may not notice this difference until after purchasing their cheap pool table, with some customers reporting warping on corners or damaged playing surfaces if they were not careful during assembly and handling.

### Brands

A few brands on the cheaper side include:

- Fat Cat
- Triumph Sports USA
- American Legend
- Free! (You'd be surprised how many free pool tables are available online.)

### _Pros of a cheap pool table:_

Pool tables in this price range are very affordable and can be found at any pool table retailer. Good for occasional pool players and kids.

### _Cons of a cheap pool table:_

These pool tables aren't of the highest quality. You won't find ball return, leather pockets or quality rails on a cheap pool table. You'll also have trouble getting billiard balls to travel in a straight line due to the unlevelness of wood backing.

## **How much is an average pool table?**

### Pricing

Medium priced pool tables can be a great option if you want something with style but still provides plenty of entertainment value without breaking the bank. They will usually range in price from $1000-$5000 depending upon quality and brand, but can go up to $8000+ with customization. These tables are taller than 34 inches; they come at 42 inches high and can reach 56 inches or higher if customized. The minimum playfield dimensions for these types of pools include 54 by 108 inches (recreational), 68 by 120 inch (competitive). Table sizes usually come in 7ft, 8ft, and 9ft. All sizes vary slightly based on manufacturer design so make sure you know how big the table is before buying one!

### Materials

Pool tables of this price range will usually use a solid wood frame, but the outside is often just veneered to look like real wood. Wood veneers are less prone to the splintering and warping. The playing surface may also be comprised of three-piece slate. This provides better quality than an MDF surface due to the slates abilty to be leveled precisely. Typically you find better quality rails with these tables. Cheaper tables my have synthetic rails that tend to harden over time whereas these tables you'll find more made of gum. Gum is the professional standard.

### Brands

Some sample brands of average billiard tables include:

- Olhausen
- Imperial Billiard Tables
- Brunswick

### _Pros of an average pool table:_

The playing surface is usually quality slate that levels more precisely. Most people prefer pool tables at this price because they are more affordable while still maintaining quality construction and materials.

### _Cons of an average pool table:_

Overall, these tables are great and don't have many cons unless you are looking for customization. Playability is what matters. Leveled slate, good felt, and good rails are all you need. These tables are perfect for any average pool player.

## **What does an expensive pool table cost?**

### Pricing

If you're looking for something to give your house a touch of class, an expensive pool table might be the answer. Expensive pool tables often have more intricate designs including carvings along edges and embossed leather pockets. These models might be worth it if you're looking for something stylish rather than utilitarian. An expensive pool table will cost $5000+ depending upon the materials and whether it is custom-made. It may seem like a lot, but some custom pool tables can fetch a price upwards of $100,000.

### Materials

The material used is by no means cheap. These tables can be comprised of any combination of wood. Cedar, pine, walnut, and oak are not out of the realm of possibility. Some frames can also be purely metal, shaped in elaborate, abstract designs. Pockets will be primarily made of leather depending on what style of table it is. The pool table will certainly have a three-piece slate top. The legs can be constructed to any design and most often hand carved. If your table requires a lot of customization, it could take up to a year to manufacture.

### Brands
