If you're reading this post, it's likely that you've found yourself in a pool hall and are wondering what the difference between all of these different looking sticks is. Pool cues (sometimes called "sticks" or "billiard cues") come in many different shapes and sizes with each one designed to accomplish a certain shot or type of ball control.

There are three common types of cues: a house cue, which is typically longer and lighter than other types of cues; a break cue, which is usually shorter and heavier than the house cue; and a snooker cue, which has very little taper to it. The most obvious difference between these three types of cues is their weight distribution at the handle end versus the butt end - this balance will determine how easy it is to control your shot with each type of cue.

## **What are pool cues made of?**

Pool cue sticks are usually made from wood or graphite, although there is a large variety to choose from in terms of material and design features.

### _Wood_

Wood cues are typically made from ash, maple or walnut but are sometimes manufactured with exotic woods such as cocobolo. Maple is the most common type of pool cue that you'll find in pool halls and retailers. Maple is a dense, hard wood that pool players say is excellent for controlling your shots.

The price of wooden cues usually range from $30 to upwards of $1500 for pool cue models made by top manufacturers.

### _Graphite_

Graphite cues are a relatively new invention, made from carbon graphite instead of wood and they also come in different weights - this type of pool cue offers the best responsiveness with power behind every shot. 

They're extremely lightweight as well making them easier to control than wooden pool cues, but more difficult to master compared to other pool cue types which may take some time getting used to for novice pool players. Graphite pool cues may also feature shafts with different tapers or tip diameters to suit varying playing styles and preferences. 

The price of graphite cues usually range from $100 to upwards of $1700 for pool cue models made by top manufacturers.

## How long are pool cues?

Standard pool cues usually measure around 57 inches (144 cm) long, although there is no rule about this length per se and some players like using shorter or longer one depending on their height and preference for stick control over power play. The standard 13mm tip size helps determine how far the stick can hit at full extension so that  pool players can have an idea of how pool cues will behave during play.

Shorter sticks  are usually about 48 inches long and are sometimes used by pool players to achieve greater control over their shots, although these pool cues tend not be as powerful because of the inability to extend them all the way. 

## How long do pool cues last?

Typically pool cues are long-lasting due to the fact that they're made out of wood. This material is usually resistant and durable so a pool cue can last for many years. However, different things like usage frequency or how well it was taken care of might decrease its lifespan. So even with high quality pool cues , you need to take good care of them otherwise they will not last as long as you want. 

For example, if your pool stick has developed a small crack after playing in humid conditions, make sure you repair it immediately before use. The problem will get worse over time and end up breaking completely on impact which will result in an expensive replacement bill. 

There are several ways you can help maintain your pool stick's quality over time: by purchasing a high-quality product that is made from durable materials, keeping it clean , maintaining the chalk and avoiding storing it somewhere in humid conditions like a pool hall.

A pool cue is an integral part of your game so you should never undervalue how important its maintenance is, as neglecting to take good care of them otherwise they will not last as long as you want them to. For example, if your pool stick has developed a small crack after playing in humid conditions, make sure you repair it immediately before continuing using it because the problem will get worse over time and end up breaking completely on impact resulting in an expensive replacement bill. 

## How to store your pool cue safely

The best way to keep your cues from breaking is by storing them properly when they are not being used. This includes keeping them away from other hard objects such as rocks or bricks so they don't chip or break on impact with these items while being stored. Keeping your cues separate from each other will also help prevent damage because there will be less of a chance for them to collide during storage. 

Another thing to note, it's better to store pool cues upright when possible. This will help pool cues retain their straightness and keep them from warping or bending. 

Wall racks are available that can be installed on the wall if you have the space or you might be better suited with a floor rack. Typically, these racks can store up to eight cues at once. 

It's best to avoiding storing your pool cue somewhere where it will be exposed to a lot of humidity or heat. The humidity will cause the cue to warp and bend, while heat will make it contract. When you do store pool cues , use an enclosed space with some ventilation like an air conditioned room. This way your pool stick won't get ruined before its time comes to be used again.

## How to repair your pool cue

Pool cue repair is also a very important thing to consider for pool players who take the game seriously, as it's possible for cue sticks to break during play. One way this can happen is if there isn't enough chalk on the tip of your pool stick when you hit the ball. Without proper chalk, friction could cause damage that could lead to chipping in some cases. Another issue occurs if your pool cue has too much chalk applied and then hits the cue ball with force - this can lead to dents or even more severe damages like splits along the shaft. 

Repairing a pool cue is a great way to save money pool cue repair is something that you can easily do yourself. Replacing the tip of your pool cue will cost around $20 dollars, but this small fee is much cheaper than buying an entirely new pool stick because it has been chipped or broken in some other way.

### _Cue Tips_

Replacing and removing pool cues tips require nothing more than a piece of scotch tape , razor blade and glue. To begin replacement process first clean off any dirt or debris on the old tip with the sticky side of scotch tape so that no particles get into your pool stick when trying to replace it. After cleaning place one end of the scotch tape over where you would like to remove your current tip slowly cut the tip  off by applying pressure to the pool cue using your razor blade. Make sure to get as close to the ferrule as you can. Once the tip is removed, use light grade sand paper to ensure the ferrule is flat and clean so the new tip can easily adhere. Clamp the new tip on to your ferrule and wait for the glue to dry. Now shape your cue with a cue tip shaping tool and you're all set! Not too shabby!

### _Shafts_

Repairing pool cue shafts can be a little more tricky than pool stick tips. If you have a pool cue shaft that is loose or has come apart at the joint, try applying some glue and clamping it back together. Once the pool cue's glued sections are dry proceed to wrapping your pool cues with scotch tape once again, this time on both ends where  the pool cue's joint is.

If you find yourself having to replace the pool shaft completely, all hope isn't lost! While pool cues are more often than not made from hard maple or fiberglass, there are a number of other materials that pool cue manufacturers use such as super high-grade plastics like polycarbonates and graphite. You can find another shaft that is compatible with your pool cue's joint and replace it, or if you are a bit more advanced, purchase an entirely new pool cue!
